# Recipe Search API which is hosted at https://recipeapp-fa140.web.app/

The purpose of this project is to practice the fundamentals of React.js and API Fetching

This website uses the Recipe Search API from spoonacular API, and contains the data for thousands of great recipes, including the instructions and the ingredients. The home page is the popular picks, with options to categorize and search to your liking. 


### I learned and used the following:
> - React.js / Hooks (State/Effect)
> - JSX, components and props, event handling, conditional rendering, Lists and Keys
> - Asynchronous API (await/async)


(React.js, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, deployed live site using Google Firebase)
